No more misleading profiles and endless conversations via messages that lead nowhere. With BIM, you will be able to directly interact, hear and feel the true personality of the other from the beginning of your meetings. Our AI-based algorithm is designed to offer you experiences that will best match your expectations while learning from your past experiences.\n\nThe cherry on the cake is that we have added lots of features that will make your life easier in the application, but we'll let you discover them for yourself.\n\n **An AI based on behavioral analysis that takes into account each of your experiences:** \n\n We have worked a lot on how to develop an AI that could reproduce dating situations as close to reality as possible. In real life, when you meet someone, you are attracted both by their appearance and their personality. Our behavioral AI takes into account interactions in the app to offer you people with affinities and values ​​that are closest to yours based on your past experiences. The more time you spend in BIM, the more refined profiles the AI ​​will offer you. \n\n **A commitment to greater inclusivity:** \n\n At BIM we are convinced that each person should be able to interact according to their choices and desires. Our platform is designed so that each gender has free access to the application in a caring and safe environment. At BIM, there is no discrimination or neglect of minorities. Make yourself comfortable, we'll take care of the rest. \n\n **Security, the cornerstone of our concept:** \n\n For us, security is our top priority. We have implemented robust security measures to ensure that every interaction on our platform is safe and enjoyable.

We believe in the power of the community to maintain a respectful and caring environment. \n\n **Our watchwords: Kindness and tolerance:** \n\n We've said it before but we'll say it again: we come here to have a good time and share. Kindness. Tolerance and openness to others allow us to meet great people and discover new horizons. \n\nSo if you don't want to be tempted by our experience, we won't hold it against you.

      "description": "**December 2024 –** MERRY CHRISTMAS - A new step taken in our adventure. After several months of research, interviews and data analysis, we are proud to announce that our market research is finally completed.  This intense work allowed us to better understand the needs and expectations of our target, and to confirm the relevance of our concept. Obviously, 100% video can be surprising at first and it is not that widespread.\n\n With this solid base, we have also finalized our business plan. All the elements are there: a clear vision, precise objectives and a well-defined action plan. We now have a roadmap for the months to come, and the excitement is building. Alongside the development of the application and the necessary adjustments after the first Beta tests, we will focus on a major objective: raising funds. Having a secure, efficient and fast application requires funds and we must also anticipate our expansion outside of Europe. This fundraising will allow us to develop more quickly and integrate new options that we are still keeping secret for the moment.\n\n Over the past few months, we have worked intensively with our developers to refine every detail of the application. We have adjusted the model to make the user experience even more immersive and intuitive. Each feature has been tested and optimized to offer a quality of interaction that best reflects the essence of our concept. But the real big news is that **the Beta version of the application is ready!** After weeks of development and internal testing, failures, bugs, headaches, we are finally able to to propose a first functional version of BIM. This is a key moment for us: seeing our ideas come to life, being able to interact with an interface that was still a sketch a few months ago.\n\n Our development objective for the coming months is ambitious: integrating new options , including the possibility of making appointments for a first meeting directly via the application. Our initial motivation being to encourage physical encounters, the app should not be a goal but a tool so that you can experience a real moment around a drink or a restaurant with your contacts.\n\n To achieve this we will need to develop partnerships with local brands, such as bars and restaurants, in order to offer ideal locations for these meetings and further enrich your user experience.\n\n We look forward to sharing this Beta version with our first testers. The feedback will be valuable to further refine the user experience and ensure that BIM becomes the video connection tool we imagined. We also expect to fix more bugs that have managed to pass through our multiple reviews.\n\n The adventure continues, and each step brings us a little closer to our goal. Thank you to everyone who supports us – your enthusiasm motivates us more than ever. See you soon for the next news!",

      "description": "**July 2024 –** A key date for BIM: our company is officially created! After months of reflection, ideas written down on paper and passionate discussions, we have finally taken this crucial step. BIM is no longer just a concept, it is now a structure ready to come to life. The brand is registered, the site is created and we are now officially “alive”.\n\n We first had to choose a country of residence to create our company and we chose Luxembourg. Why Luxembourg? Because it is a real cultural crossroads, in the heart of Europe. This strategic location allows us to be connected to a diversity of cultures and perspectives, which perfectly reflects the soul of BIM: an inclusive and universal platform.In addition, Luxembourg has an ultra dynamic economic environment and the arrangements for starting a business are simpler compared to other European countries. We will therefore be able to focus a little more on the app itself and a little less on the administrative part.\n\n In recent weeks, we have immersed ourselves in design and development. Finding a design that was both original and able to appeal to as many people as possible was a real challenge. We wanted to create a strong visual identity, which reflects our vision while being accessible and intuitive for our users. After numerous tests, adjustments and feedback, we believe we have found the perfect balance. Hoping that the Beta testers will appreciate the effort…Otherwise we will start again until we find the right formula. This is also entrepreneurship. The creation of the company marks a turning point in this adventure. There is still a long way to go, but we are ready to take on all the challenges to bring BIM to life. \n\nOf course, things don't always go smoothly. Technical obstacles, complex decisions and unforeseen adjustments are part of everyday life. But each step brings us a little closer to our goal. With every meeting, prototype and adjustment, BIM takes shape. \n\n At the same time, we have been working on solutions to ensure a secure user experience.As the issue of online safety is crucial, we have implemented a community moderation system combined with an effective reporting mechanism. This system seems to us to be a solid option for creating a respectful and protected environment. Here again it will be necessary to review the users to see if this approach was the right one. \n\n We will keep you informed of our next progress. Next target: The finalization of the Beta test and the various studies.",
