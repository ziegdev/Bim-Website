      "description": "We too have been on dating apps, we too have lots of stories to tell (good and bad) and like you we said to ourselves that sending text messages on apps in 2024 was a bit has been. And we're not even talking about the exorbitant price offered on the market. \n\nAt BIM, we believe that we can change the order established by the market behemoths. We thought about what we would like to see in a dating app and here is what came out:\n- **More authenticity**: The fake profile, the profile photo that does not reflect reality, the lies about the physical appearance... it's fun for 5 minutes, but in the long run it becomes boring. The video allows you to see live if the charm works.\n- **More instantaneity**: Thank you but waiting for the other person's response that will come we don't know when... no thanks. Here again, the video solves the problem of live discussions to know in 15 minutes if you want to go further or not.\n- **More security**: We have all heard horrible stories about meetings that went badly. Socializing, looking for love or fun should never be a cause for concern. Here again we have focused on security with a community moderation system coupled with an algorithm that filters out unhealthy people.\n\nSo yes, the video can be intriguing, but deep down what is better? Fantasizing about 3 photos and wasting 3 hours of your time before potentially being disappointed during a date or launching a video meeting from the start and seeing if the charm works?\n\nOn the pricing side, we have also tried to be as fair as possible. Already if you are among the first thousand to pre-register, it is free for 3 months. Otherwise you can sponsor your friends. Here again this gives you free access to BIM for a limited time. Finally, when the time comes, if you are happy with us, you will be able to subscribe to a premium subscription for the price of a Netflix subscription.",

      "description": "**December 2024 –** MERRY CHRISTMAS - A new step taken in our adventure. After several months of research, interviews and data analysis, we are proud to announce that our market research is finally completed.  This intense work allowed us to better understand the needs and expectations of our target, and to confirm the relevance of our concept. Obviously, 100% video can be surprising at first and it is not that widespread.\n\n With this solid base, we have also finalized our business plan. All the elements are there: a clear vision, precise objectives and a well-defined action plan. We now have a roadmap for the months to come, and the excitement is building. Alongside the development of the application and the necessary adjustments after the first Beta tests, we will focus on a major objective: raising funds. Having a secure, efficient and fast application requires funds and we must also anticipate our expansion outside of Europe. This fundraising will allow us to develop more quickly and integrate new options that we are still keeping secret for the moment.\n\n Over the past few months, we have worked intensively with our developers to refine every detail of the application. We have adjusted the model to make the user experience even more immersive and intuitive. Each feature has been tested and optimized to offer a quality of interaction that best reflects the essence of our concept. But the real big news is that **the Beta version of the application is ready!** After weeks of development and internal testing, failures, bugs, headaches, we are finally able to to propose a first functional version of BIM. This is a key moment for us: seeing our ideas come to life, being able to interact with an interface that was still a sketch a few months ago.\n\n Our development objective for the coming months is ambitious: integrating new options , including the possibility of making appointments for a first meeting directly via the application. Our initial motivation being to encourage physical encounters, the app should not be a goal but a tool so that you can experience a real moment around a drink or a restaurant with your contacts.\n\n To achieve this we will need to develop partnerships with local brands, such as bars and restaurants, in order to offer ideal locations for these meetings and further enrich your user experience.\n\n We look forward to sharing this Beta version with our first testers. The feedback will be valuable to further refine the user experience and ensure that BIM becomes the video connection tool we imagined. We also expect to fix more bugs that have managed to pass through our multiple reviews.\n\n The adventure continues, and each step brings us a little closer to our goal. Thank you to everyone who supports us – your enthusiasm motivates us more than ever. See you soon for the next news!",

      "description": "**July 2024 –** A key date for BIM: our company is officially created! After months of reflection, ideas written down on paper and passionate discussions, we have finally taken this crucial step. BIM is no longer just a concept, it is now a structure ready to come to life. The brand is registered, the site is created and we are now officially “alive”.\n\n We first had to choose a country of residence to create our company and we chose Luxembourg. Why Luxembourg? Because it is a real cultural crossroads, in the heart of Europe. This strategic location allows us to be connected to a diversity of cultures and perspectives, which perfectly reflects the soul of BIM: an inclusive and universal platform.In addition, Luxembourg has an ultra dynamic economic environment and the arrangements for starting a business are simpler compared to other European countries. We will therefore be able to focus a little more on the app itself and a little less on the administrative part.\n\n In recent weeks, we have immersed ourselves in design and development. Finding a design that was both original and able to appeal to as many people as possible was a real challenge. We wanted to create a strong visual identity, which reflects our vision while being accessible and intuitive for our users. After numerous tests, adjustments and feedback, we believe we have found the perfect balance. Hoping that the Beta testers will appreciate the effort…Otherwise we will start again until we find the right formula. This is also entrepreneurship. The creation of the company marks a turning point in this adventure. There is still a long way to go, but we are ready to take on all the challenges to bring BIM to life. \n\nOf course, things don't always go smoothly. Technical obstacles, complex decisions and unforeseen adjustments are part of everyday life. But each step brings us a little closer to our goal. With every meeting, prototype and adjustment, BIM takes shape. \n\n At the same time, we have been working on solutions to ensure a secure user experience.As the issue of online safety is crucial, we have implemented a community moderation system combined with an effective reporting mechanism. This system seems to us to be a solid option for creating a respectful and protected environment. Here again it will be necessary to review the users to see if this approach was the right one. \n\n We will keep you informed of our next progress. Next target: The finalization of the Beta test and the various studies.",
