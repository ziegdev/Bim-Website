      "description": "We too have been on dating apps, we too have lots of stories to tell (good and bad) and like you we said to ourselves that sending text messages on apps in 2024 was a bit has been. And we're not even talking about the exorbitant price offered on the market. \n\nAt BIM, we believe that we can change the order established by the market behemoths. We thought about what we would like to see in a dating app and here is what came out:\n- **More authenticity**: The fake profile, the profile photo that does not reflect reality, the lies about the physical appearance... it's fun for 5 minutes, but in the long run it becomes boring. The video allows you to see live if the charm works.\n- **More instantaneity**: Thank you but waiting for the other person's response that will come we don't know when... no thanks. Here again, the video solves the problem of live discussions to know in 15 minutes if you want to go further or not.\n- **More security**: We have all heard horrible stories about meetings that went badly. Socializing, looking for love or fun should never be a cause for concern. Here again we have focused on security with a community moderation system coupled with an algorithm that filters out unhealthy people.\n\nSo yes, the video can be intriguing, but deep down what is better? Fantasizing about 3 photos and wasting 3 hours of your time before potentially being disappointed during a date or launching a video meeting from the start and seeing if the charm works?\n\nOn the pricing side, we have also tried to be as fair as possible. Already if you are among the first thousand to pre-register, it is free for 3 months. Otherwise you can sponsor your friends. Here again this gives you free access to BIM for a limited time. Finally, when the time comes, if you are happy with us, you will be able to subscribe to a premium subscription for the price of a Netflix subscription.",

Discover a new universe built around video for more authentic encounters. We have created a space where you can be yourself and meet people according to your desires. No more misleading profiles and endless conversations via messages that lead nowhere. With BIM, you will be able to directly interact, hear and feel the true personality of the other from the beginning of your meetings. Our AI-based algorithm is designed to offer you experiences that will best match your expectations while learning from your past experiences.\n\nThe cherry on the cake is that we have added lots of features that will make your life easier in the application, but we'll let you discover them for yourself.\n\n **An AI based on behavioral analysis that takes into account each of your experiences:** \n\n We have worked a lot on how to develop an AI that could reproduce dating situations as close to reality as possible. In real life, when you meet someone, you are attracted both by their appearance and their personality. Our behavioral AI takes into account interactions in the app to offer you people with affinities and values â€‹â€‹that are closest to yours based on your past experiences. The more time you spend in BIM, the more refined profiles the AI â€‹â€‹will offer you. \n\n **A commitment to greater inclusivity:** \n\n At BIM we are convinced that each person should be able to interact according to their choices and desires. Our platform is designed so that each gender has free access to the application in a caring and safe environment. At BIM, there is no discrimination or neglect of minorities. Make yourself comfortable, we'll take care of the rest. \n\n **Security, the cornerstone of our concept:** \n\n For us, security is our top priority. We have implemented robust security measures to ensure that every interaction on our platform is safe and enjoyable. We have implemented community moderation with strict rules that will exclude any user who is not in line with our ethical charter.\n\nAs a user, you can report any inappropriate or suspicious behavior. We believe in the power of the community to maintain a respectful and caring environment. \n\n **Our watchwords: Kindness and tolerance:** \n\n We've said it before but we'll say it again: we come here to have a good time and share. Kindness. Tolerance and openness to others allow us to meet great people and discover new horizons. \n\nSo if you don't want to be tempted by our experience, we won't hold it against you. But don't stop others. We hope you find what you're looking for ðŸ˜Š",
